#  Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team.

## Objective

In this project, I built a comprehensive Active Directory environment within a home lab setup to enhance my practical knowledge of IT infrastructure and cybersecurity. I configured Windows Server as a domain controller, integrated Splunk for security event monitoring, and simulated a Brute Force attack using Kali Linux. By leveraging Atomic Red Team, I explored real-world attack scenarios and improved my ability to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents. This hands-on project allowed me to sharpen both blue team and red team skills, expanding my expertise in security operations and cloud infrastructure management.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of Active Directory management and domain controller configuration.
- Proficiency in configuring and using SIEM tools, specifically Splunk, for security monitoring and analysis.
- Ability to simulate and analyze Brute Force attacks and other cybersecurity threats using Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team.
- Enhanced knowledge of network security, including vulnerability assessment and attack detection.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in responding to cybersecurity incidents and mitigating risks.

### Tools Used

- Windows Server 2022: For setting up and configuring Active Directory and domain controller.
- Windows 10: As the client machine for joining the domain and testing security configurations.
- Kali Linux: Used for simulating Brute Force attacks and exploring penetration testing tools.
- Splunk: For collecting, analyzing, and visualizing security telemetry and logs from the Windows Server and target machines.
- Atomic Red Team: For executing predefined attack simulations to test security controls and monitoring capabilities.
- VirtualBox: To create and manage virtual machines for the lab environment.
- Sysmon: Used for advanced system monitoring and logging on the target machines to capture detailed event data.
